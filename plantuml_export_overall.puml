:Load datasets: 
- Patients
- Encounters
- Medications
- Allergies
- Procedures;

:Read and reference the Data Dictionary;

:Filter Encounters for Drug Overdose \nAND encounters after July 15, 1999;
:Calculate patient's age at time of encounter;
if (Age between 18 and 35?) then (yes)
  :Include encounter in study cohort;
else (no)
  :Exclude encounter;
endif

:Join datasets to build the complete cohort\n(using descriptive table aliases);
:Compute additional fields:
  - DEATH_AT_VISIT_IND (based on death date during encounter)
  - COUNT_CURRENT_MEDS (active medications at start of encounter)
  - CURRENT_OPIOID_IND (flag if active med is on opioids list)
  
:Calculate Readmission Indicators using window functions:
  - Compute next_enc_START via lead() over patient partition ordered by encounter dates;
  - Calculate diff_days (difference in days between encounters);
  - Set READMISSION_90_DAY_IND flag (1 if next encounter within 90 days, else 0);
  - Set READMISSION_30_DAY_IND flag (1 if next encounter within 30 days, else 0);
  - Update next_enc_START to "N/A" if diff_days is 0;
  - Rename next_enc_START to FIRST_READMISSION_DATE;

:Export the final cohort dataset to CSV;
